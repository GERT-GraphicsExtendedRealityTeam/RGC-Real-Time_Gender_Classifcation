Gender-Classifcation-Of-Human-Faces
===================================

Face is one of the most important part in human. Arguably, images of human face provide a lot of information such as age, gender, ethnicity, identity, expression...etc. Therefore gender recognition by face is consider one of the ac- tive research area of computer vision; there are huge numbers of applications where gender recognition can be useful, like biometric, authentication, high- tech surveillance, security systems, criminology and augmented reality...etc. Not surprisingly, thus, that a very large number of studies has investigated gender recognition from face perception in humans. I did this project for Machine Learning course. Please read the Nadine Report of Machine Learning Project.pdf for more information and watch video for the results: https://vimeo.com/90117910
